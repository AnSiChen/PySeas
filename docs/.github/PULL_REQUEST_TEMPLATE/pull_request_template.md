# How to make a pull request:
Go to this website for help: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

## Use this template to explain your pull request:
- Short one line title.
- Longer description of what the change does (if the title isn't enough).
- An explanation of why the change is being made.
- Perhaps a discussion of context and/or alternatives that were considered
- Another useful rule of thumb is to avoid needing ‘and’ in your commit messages. If you did ‘A’ and ‘B’ maybe they are two separate changes.
